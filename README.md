**Huffman Compression Library**

**Description:**
The Huffman Compression Library is a C library for file compression and decompression using the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman coding is a widely used method for lossless data compression, particularly efficient for text and other data with non-uniform character frequencies. This library provides efficient compression by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters, resulting in reduced file sizes. With its simple interface, the library can be seamlessly integrated into various applications, including file compression tools, data transmission optimization, and embedded systems.

**Features:**
Efficient Compression: Generates optimal Huffman codes based on character frequencies.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use functions for compression and decompression operations.
Portability: Compatible with any platform with a C compiler.
Dependency-free: No external dependencies, ensuring easy deployment.
Open Source: Released under the MIT License for free use and modification.

**Usage:**
Include the "huffman_utility.h" header file in your C project.
Call the provided functions to compress and decompress files as needed.
